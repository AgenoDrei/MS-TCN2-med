# MS-TCN2 for surgery recordings
 Aim of this project is adapting the below action segementation for surgery phase recognition in medical recordings and specifically for cataract surgery:
 - based on the great publication and code from the publication MS-TCN++: Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network for Action Segmentation (TPAMI 2020)
 - [MS-TCN++: Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network for Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09220.pdf).
   
## Datasets 
- provide two datasets
- Adaption of the Cataract 101 dataset for this architecture
- Creation of a novel Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) dataset
- Preprocessing and evaluation tools for both datasets

## Based on:
